# zoo-animal-classification-python
A Python-based data analysis and classification project using the Zoo dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to understand animal characteristics.


# 🐾 Zoo Animal Classification using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying animals using the **Zoo Dataset**.
It demonstrates core **Python data analysis skills**, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand animal characteristics such as legs, habitat, and biological features.

The project is ideal for beginners in **data science and machine learning** who want hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
